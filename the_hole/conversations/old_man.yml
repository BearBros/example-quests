    text:
      en: I'm just old man now. Long time ago I was great warrior like you but this time has passed. Now I'm just sitting here, at my house and thinking what to do with that hole over there. I'm sure you saw it already.
    pointer: why,what,bye
  here:
    text:
      en: You see, I built this house with my own hands, back in the days when I could lift a tree with my bare hands. I cannot leave this place, even if it means certain death. Which wouldn't be such a bad thing in my age anyway.

      en: They attacked travelers, tearing men apart, raping women and killing children without mercy. All I could do was to look through my window, unable to help.

  that3:
    text:
      en: After some time people stopped coming and monsters hid from sunlight in their Hole. I don't think this is natural. It's probably some necromancer's doing. Bloody wizards, won't leave decent people alone!

  offer_hole:
    text:
      en: I will give you a key. I found it when some skeleton dropped it on my doormat. It's probably important. And did I mention all those plundered caravans? The goods must be there, in The Hole, am I right?

      en: What? Show me. Hmm... It looks like we may have a problem. Back in the days, when I was an adventurer like you, I saw a similar scroll. It belonged to a powerful wizard. So I was right.
    pointer: scroll_found2
  about_scroll2:
    text:
      en: It's a necromancer. Fucking magicians! I can still feel his aura emanating from this scroll. It looks like this bastard is somewhere under my fishing lake! Could you go there and kill him?
    pointer: scroll_found3
  about_scroll3:
    text:
      en: You can find his lair with this teleportation scroll, you just need a diamond. A regular diamond, just like every else. Sadly I don't have any, I sold all of them long time ago. You'll have to acquire one on your own.
